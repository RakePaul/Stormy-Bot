# Stormy-Bot
This bot code takes events from your server, and announces events in the selected channel ID. It also adds a cool command for weather related events.
Make sure to replace your channel IDs and bot code inside the file, or it will not work.
Contact me if you want to have the version that does not announce already existent events that have been announced already (Has data base)
